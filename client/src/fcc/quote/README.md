## Project: Build a Random Quote Machine
### Overview
For the Random Quote Machine, a minimalist design help focus on the loaded quote.

The live demo for the Random Quote Machine can be accessed here: [Random Quote Machine](http://jvdsande.github.io/fcc-projects/fcc/quote)

### User Stories
#### I can click a button to show me a new random quote.
A button is available below the author's name to load a new random quote.
Quotes are loaded using a double buffering system in order to avoid wait time from the API when loading next quotes.

#### I can press a button to tweet out a quote.
Next to the New Quote button is a Twitter button. All quotes are loaded so that the message, author and added hashtags are less than 140 characters so they can always be tweeted.
