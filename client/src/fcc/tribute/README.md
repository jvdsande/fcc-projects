## Project: Build a Tribute Page
### Overview
I chose for this project to build a Tribute Page for late Chester Bennington, Linkin Park's lead singer. Linkin Park was my favorite band during my teenage years, and his sudden death came as a full blown shock.

Regarding the development, I decided to implement a parallax background in order to make the page more interactive than a simple static HTML page.

The live demo can be accessed here: [Tribute Page](http://jvdsande.github.io/fcc-projects/fcc/tribute)

### User Stories
#### I can view a tribute page with an image and text.
The tribute page shows three paragraphs, interleaved with three images of Chester Bennington

#### I can click on a link that will take me to an external website with further information on the topic.
The footer of the page provides two links: one to Chester Bennington's [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester_Bennington), and one to Linkin Park's [official tribute page](http://chester.linkinpark.com/)
