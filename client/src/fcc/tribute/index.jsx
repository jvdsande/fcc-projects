             Linkin Park recruited vocalist Chester Bennington in March 1999. Bennington became a standout among applicants because of the dynamic in his singing style.
             The newborn vocal chemistry between Shinoda and Bennington helped revive the band, inciting them to work on new material.
             In 1999 the band released a self-titled extended play. The band released its breakthrough album, Hybrid Theory, the following year.

            Bennington's death occurred on what would have been Chris Cornell's 53rd birthday. Shinoda noted that Bennington was very emotional when the band performed "One More Light" in his honor, where he could not finish singing the song, be it in rehearsal or in a live performance setting.

            Bennington's funeral was held at South Coast Botanic Garden in Palos Verdes, California on July 29.
